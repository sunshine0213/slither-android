/**
 * <h1>Mad Snakes<h1/>
 * <p>
 * This is a simplified clone of the Slither.io game. The player plays against 5 enemies and tries
 * to earn as much points possible before the game ends. Player earns a point for each food consumed,
 * 50 points for killing an enemy and 5000 points for surviving until the end of the game.
 * <p>
 * There are 3 types of snakes spawning. Aggressive, Passive and Hybrid. Aggressive snakes just
 * follow player's head and tries to kill him. Hybrid snakes follow the closest food source and attacks
 * the player when he gets close. Passive snakes try to find the nearest safe food source and survive
 * as long as possible.
 * <p>
 * Enemy snakes can't collide with one another and are allowed to go out of bounds. Player snake however
 * is not.
